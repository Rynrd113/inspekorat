# Vite Asset Loading Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Vite Development Server Not Running**
- **Problem**: The modules were failing to load from `http://localhost:5173`
- **Solution**: Started the Vite development server with `npm run dev`
- **Result**: Vite server now running on port 5173 and serving assets

### 2. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Blocking Resources**
- **Problem**: CSP was blocking:
  - Vite development server assets (localhost:5173)
  - External fonts from fonts.bunny.net
  - Font Awesome from cdnjs.cloudflare.com
- **Solution**: Modified `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php` to:
  - Detect development environment
  - Allow Vite dev server ports (5173-5177)
  - Allow external font and CDN resources
  - Use different CSP rules for development vs production

### 3. **Vite Configuration**
- **Problem**: Vite configuration had HMR on wrong port
- **Solution**: Updated `vite.config.js` to use port 5173 consistently

## Files Modified

1. **app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php**
   - Added environment detection
   - Implemented separate CSP rules for development and production
   - Added support for multiple Vite ports
   - Added external resource permissions

2. **vite.config.js**
   - Fixed HMR port configuration
   - Ensured consistent port 5173 usage

3. **.env**
   - Added `VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5173`

## Current Status

✅ **Vite Development Server**: Running on port 5173  
✅ **Laravel Server**: Running on port 8000  
✅ **Asset Loading**: All CSS and JS files accessible  
✅ **CSP Headers**: Properly configured for development  
✅ **External Resources**: Fonts and CDN assets allowed  

## Development Workflow

### To Start Development:
1. **Start Vite dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Start Laravel server**: `php artisan serve`
3. **Clear caches if needed**: `php artisan cache:clear`

### To Check Asset Status:
Run the verification script: `./check_vite_assets.sh`

## Production Considerations

The CSP configuration automatically switches to production mode when `APP_ENV` is not `local`. In production:
- Vite development server URLs are not allowed
- Only necessary external resources are permitted
- More restrictive security headers are applied

## Asset Loading Process

1. **Development**: Assets are served by Vite dev server with HMR
2. **Production**: Assets are built and served as static files
3. **Laravel Integration**: Uses `@vite()` directive in Blade templates

## Security Features

- **Environment-aware CSP**: Different rules for dev/prod
- **Multiple port support**: Handles Vite's port allocation
- **External resource control**: Specific allowlist for CDNs
- **Security headers**: Full suite of security headers applied

Your application should now load assets correctly without CSP errors!
